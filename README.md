#### Quick Setup for Existing Projects

> **Note:** These steps are for adding a5c to an existing repository. For new projects, use the template above.

1. **📋 Add Configuration Files to Your Existing Repository**
   
   **Create `.github/workflows/a5c.yml`:**
   ```yaml
   name: a5c AI Agents
   on:
     issues:
       types: [opened, edited]
     issue_comment:
       types: [created, edited]
     pull_request:
       types: [opened, edited, synchronize]
     pull_request_review_comment:
       types: [created, edited]
   
   jobs:
     a5c:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v4
         - name: Run a5c AI Agents
           uses: a5c-ai/agent-runner@v1
           with:
             github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
             ai-provider: ${{ vars.A5C_CLI_TOOL }}
             openai-key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
             anthropic-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
             azure-key: ${{ secrets.AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY }}
             azure-project: ${{ vars.AZURE_OPENAI_PROJECT_NAME }}
             gemini-key: ${{ secrets.GEMINI_API_KEY }}
   ```
   
   **Create `.a5c/config.yml`:**
   ```yaml
   version: "1.0"
   agents:
     remote:
       enabled: true
       sources:
         - "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a5c-ai/registry/main/agents/development/team-installer-agent.agent.md"
         - "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a5c-ai/registry/main/agents/development/developer-agent.agent.md"
         - "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a5c-ai/registry/main/agents/development/validator-agent.agent.md"
         - "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a5c-ai/registry/main/agents/development/build-fixer-agent.agent.md"
         - "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a5c-ai/registry/main/agents/communication/content-writer-agent.agent.md"
         - "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a5c-ai/registry/main/agents/development/producer-agent.agent.md"
         - "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a5c-ai/registry/main/agents/development/conflict-resolver-agent.agent.md"
         - "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a5c-ai/registry/main/agents/sre/azure-sre-engineer-agent.agent.md"
   ```

2. **🔧 Configure GitHub Permissions**
   
   **Settings → Actions → General:**
   - ✅ Select **"Read and write permissions"**
   - ✅ Check **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"**
   
   **Settings → General:**
   - ✅ Enable **"Issues"**
   - ✅ Enable **"Actions"**

   **Organization Visibility** (if using GitHub organization):
   - ✅ If your repo is in an organization, make yourself a public member
   - ✅ Go to: `https://github.com/orgs/your-org-name/people`
   - ✅ Settings → Member privileges → Make yourself visible

3. **🔑 Add AI Provider Secrets**
   
   Go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** and add:
   
   | Provider | Secret | Variable |
   |----------|--------|----------|
   | **OpenAI** | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `A5C_CLI_TOOL=codex` |
   | **Claude** | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `A5C_CLI_TOOL=claude` |
   | **Azure OpenAI** | `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` | `A5C_CLI_TOOL=azure_codex` |
   | **Gemini** | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | `A5C_CLI_TOOL=gemini` |

4. **🎯 Activate Your Team**
   
   Create these initial issues:
   
   ```markdown
   # Issue 2: Install Team
   @ team-installer-agent Install all the relevant missing agent from the registry.
   ```

2. **🏷️ Tag Agents** - Use `@agent-name` to assign specialized agents
3. **🤖 AI Analysis** - Agents analyze your codebase and requirements
4. **📤 Pull Requests** - Agents create PRs with implementations
5. **👀 Review & Iterate** - Collaborate with agents through PR comments
6. **✅ Deploy** - Merge when ready, agents handle the rest

## 💡 Example Workflows

### Add a New Feature
```markdown
@ developer-agent

Create a user authentication system with:
- Email/password login
- JWT tokens for session management
- Password reset functionality
- Protected routes middleware

Follow security best practices and add comprehensive tests.
```

### Fix a Build Issue
```markdown
@ build-fixer-agent

The CI pipeline is failing on the `test:integration` step. 
The error mentions database connection issues in the test environment.
Please investigate and fix the test configuration.
```

### Create Documentation
```markdown
@ content-writer-agent

Create API documentation for the user management endpoints in `/src/api/users/`.
Include request/response examples, error codes, and authentication requirements.
Format as OpenAPI/Swagger specification.
```

---

## ⚡ What to Expect

- **First Setup**: 2-5 minutes for agents to initialize
- **Issue Response**: 1-5 minutes for agent acknowledgment
- **PR Creation**: 5-30 minutes depending on task complexity
- **Iteration Speed**: Near-instant responses to feedback

---

## 💰 Cost Awareness

Complex projects may cost $20-50. Set usage limits in your AI provider dashboard.

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Agents Not Responding?

1. Check GitHub Actions permissions (most common issue)
2. Verify AI provider API key is set correctly
3. Ensure "Issues" and "Actions" are enabled
4. Check organization visibility (if using GitHub org)
5. Manually trigger agent activation by commenting on the issue or ticket:
   ```markdown
   @ team-installer-agent please assemble team.
   ```
   or
   ```markdown
   @ developer-agent do it.
   ```

### High API Costs?
- Set usage limits in your AI provider dashboard
- Use more specific issue descriptions to reduce iteration
- Review and approve PRs promptly to avoid re-work

### Build Failures?
- Tag `@ build-fixer-agent` in the failing PR or create a new issue
- Check Actions tab for detailed error logs
- Agents will automatically retry failed builds
