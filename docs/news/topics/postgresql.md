# PostgreSQL

## Summary

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system with over 30 years of active development. It has earned a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance. PostgreSQL runs on all major operating systems and is ACID-compliant, supporting foreign keys, joins, views, triggers, and stored procedures.

PostgreSQL is known for its extensibility, allowing users to define custom data types, custom functions, and procedural languages. It supports a wide range of data types, including primitive types, structured types, document types (JSON/JSONB), and geometric types. PostgreSQL's advanced features like table inheritance, multi-version concurrency control, and point-in-time recovery make it suitable for complex enterprise applications.

The PostgreSQL Global Development Group regularly releases updates that improve performance, security, and add new features. Staying informed about PostgreSQL updates is essential for database administrators and developers to maintain secure, efficient database systems and leverage the latest capabilities.
