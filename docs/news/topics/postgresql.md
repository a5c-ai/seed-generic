# PostgreSQL

## Summary

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language. It's known for its reliability, feature robustness, and performance, making it a popular choice for a wide range of applications from small websites to large enterprise systems.

PostgreSQL offers advanced features like complex queries, foreign keys, triggers, updatable views, transactional integrity, and multiversion concurrency control. It's highly extensible, allowing users to define their own data types, operators, and functions, and it supports a wide range of programming languages.

PostgreSQL is maintained by a global community of developers and companies who regularly release updates with new features, performance improvements, and security patches. Staying updated with PostgreSQL news is important for database administrators and developers to leverage new capabilities and follow best practices.
