# Node.js

## Summary

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. It allows developers to use JavaScript for server-side scripting and building scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.

Node.js has become a cornerstone of modern web development, enabling JavaScript to be used for both frontend and backend development. Its package ecosystem, npm (Node Package Manager), is the largest ecosystem of open-source libraries in the world, providing developers with tools and modules for almost any use case.

The Node.js team regularly releases updates that improve performance, security, and compatibility with modern JavaScript features. Staying informed about Node.js updates is essential for maintaining secure and efficient server-side applications and taking advantage of the latest JavaScript capabilities.
