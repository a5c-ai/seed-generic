# Node.js

## Summary

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that enables server-side execution of JavaScript code. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, ideal for data-intensive real-time applications. Node.js is widely used for building scalable network applications and is a fundamental technology for most modern JavaScript frameworks.

This repository uses Node.js v22 in its build and deployment workflows, making it a key technology for projects created from this template.
