# Node.js

## Summary

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, enabling developers to run JavaScript on the server side. It provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient for building scalable network applications.

Node.js is widely used for backend services, APIs, microservices, and tooling. Its package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open-source libraries in the world, providing modules for virtually any functionality.

Staying current with Node.js developments is important for security updates, performance improvements, and new features that can enhance server-side JavaScript development.
