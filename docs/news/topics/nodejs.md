# Node.js

## Summary

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. It allows developers to use JavaScript to write command-line tools and server-side scripts. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.

Node.js has become a fundamental technology for building scalable network applications and is widely used for backend development. It has a vast ecosystem of packages through npm (Node Package Manager), which is one of the largest software registries in the world.

Following Node.js updates is crucial for developers to stay informed about new runtime features, performance improvements, security patches, and best practices for server-side JavaScript development.
