# Tailwind CSS

## Summary

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs without leaving your HTML. Unlike other CSS frameworks that provide pre-designed components, Tailwind focuses on giving developers the building blocks to create their own unique designs.

Tailwind CSS promotes a different approach to styling where you compose styles by applying pre-existing utility classes directly in your markup. This approach leads to faster development, more consistent designs, and smaller CSS bundle sizes when properly configured with purging.

Tailwind CSS is actively developed and regularly updated with new features, utilities, and improvements. Staying updated with Tailwind CSS news is important for frontend developers to leverage new capabilities, follow best practices, and understand how to optimize Tailwind for production environments.
