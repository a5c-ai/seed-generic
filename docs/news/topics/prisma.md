# Prisma

## Summary

Prisma is a next-generation ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool that consists of a set of tools and libraries for database access in Node.js and TypeScript applications. It includes Prisma Client (a type-safe query builder), Prisma Migrate (for database migrations), and Prisma Studio (a GUI to view and edit data).

Prisma simplifies database workflows by providing a strongly typed API that helps catch errors at compile time rather than runtime. It supports multiple databases, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, MongoDB, and CockroachDB.

Following Prisma updates is crucial for developers to stay informed about new features, performance improvements, and evolving best practices for database access and management.
