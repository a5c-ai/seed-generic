# TypeScript

## Summary

TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, adding static type definitions. It is developed and maintained by Microsoft and is designed for development of large applications. TypeScript code is transpiled to JavaScript, which can run on any JavaScript engine.

TypeScript adds features like static typing, classes, interfaces, and other advanced concepts that make it easier to detect errors during development rather than at runtime. This results in more robust code, better developer tooling, and improved maintainability of large codebases.

As a superset of JavaScript, TypeScript continuously evolves to support the latest JavaScript features while adding its own enhancements. Staying updated with TypeScript news is crucial for developers to leverage new language features, performance improvements, and tooling updates.
