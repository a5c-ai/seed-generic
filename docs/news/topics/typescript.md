# TypeScript

## Summary

TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, adding static type definitions. It is developed and maintained by Microsoft, and it provides optional static typing, classes, and interfaces to help build robust applications. TypeScript code is transpiled to JavaScript, which can run on any JavaScript engine.

TypeScript enhances developer productivity by enabling better tooling, improved code quality, and earlier detection of potential errors. It has gained widespread adoption in the JavaScript ecosystem, particularly for large-scale applications where type safety becomes increasingly important.

The TypeScript team regularly releases updates that improve type checking, add new language features, and enhance compatibility with the latest JavaScript standards. Staying informed about TypeScript updates is crucial for leveraging new language capabilities and maintaining type-safe code bases.
