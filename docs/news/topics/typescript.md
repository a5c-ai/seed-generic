# TypeScript

## Summary

TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript by adding static type definitions. It is developed and maintained by Microsoft, offering improved tooling, better code quality, and enhanced developer experience through type checking.

TypeScript compiles to standard JavaScript and can be used in any JavaScript environment. It's widely adopted in modern web development for building more maintainable and scalable applications, with strong integration into popular frameworks and libraries.

Keeping up with TypeScript developments is essential for leveraging new language features, type system improvements, and tooling enhancements that can benefit development workflows.
