# TypeScript

## Summary

TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale. It adds static types to JavaScript, allowing developers to catch errors early in the development process rather than at runtime. TypeScript is developed and maintained by Microsoft.

TypeScript enhances code quality, improves developer productivity through better tooling, and makes code more maintainable, especially for large-scale applications. It has become an industry standard for JavaScript development, particularly in enterprise environments.

Keeping track of TypeScript updates is important for developers to leverage new language features, type system improvements, and performance enhancements in their applications.
