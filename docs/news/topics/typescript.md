# TypeScript

## Summary

TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, providing enhanced developer tooling, static type checking, and improved code organization. This topic tracks developments in the TypeScript language, compiler, and ecosystem.

The TypeScript landscape includes language feature additions, type system improvements, compiler optimizations, and ecosystem tooling. These developments influence how developers write, structure, and maintain code in TypeScript-based projects.

For applications built with TypeScript, staying current with language updates and best practices is essential for leveraging new features, improving type safety, and ensuring compatibility with the broader JavaScript ecosystem.
