# React

## Summary

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It's maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies. React allows developers to build reusable UI components and manage the state of those components efficiently.

React uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering performance and follows a component-based architecture that encourages reusable code. It has a vast ecosystem of libraries and tools that extend its capabilities for state management, routing, styling, and more.

React's declarative approach to building UIs has made it one of the most popular frontend libraries, used by many companies across various industries. Keeping up with React updates is important for developers to leverage new features, performance improvements, and best practices.
