# React

## Summary

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies. React allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage application state efficiently.

React's component-based architecture makes it easier to build and maintain complex user interfaces. It uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering performance and provides a declarative approach to UI development. React's ecosystem includes numerous libraries and tools that extend its capabilities.

The React team regularly releases updates that introduce new features, improve performance, and enhance the developer experience. Staying informed about React updates is essential for maintaining modern, efficient web applications and adopting best practices in frontend development.
