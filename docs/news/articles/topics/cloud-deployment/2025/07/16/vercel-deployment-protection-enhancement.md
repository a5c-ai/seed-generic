# Vercel Enhances Deployment Protection for All Project Domains

**Source:** https://vercel.com/changelog
**Date:** 2025-07-14
**Author:** Vercel Team
**Topic:** Cloud Deployment

## Summary

Vercel has announced a significant enhancement to their Standard Deployment Protection feature, expanding security coverage to all automatically generated domains, including production branch git domains (e.g., project-git-main.vercel.app). This update, released on July 14, 2025, applies automatically to all new projects created after the release date.

The enhanced deployment protection ensures that all project domains, not just production domains, are safeguarded with Vercel's security features. This is particularly important for teams that use preview deployments or branch-specific deployments for testing and review purposes, as these environments often contain pre-production code or features that should be protected from unauthorized access.

For existing projects, the new protection behavior is not automatically applied. Instead, project administrators can update to this enhanced protection through the Project Settings page in the Vercel dashboard. This approach ensures backward compatibility for existing workflows while allowing teams to opt into the improved security model at their convenience.

## Relevance to Cloud Deployment

This update represents Vercel's continued focus on enhancing security across their platform while maintaining flexibility for different deployment workflows. By extending protection to all project domains, Vercel is addressing potential security gaps in the development lifecycle where preview or branch deployments might contain sensitive features or data that should not be publicly accessible without authorization.

The approach of applying the new behavior automatically to new projects while making it optional for existing ones demonstrates Vercel's commitment to balancing security improvements with minimal disruption to established workflows. This is particularly relevant for organizations that use Vercel for multiple projects and need to manage security policies across their deployment infrastructure.

## Key Insights

- Review your project's deployment protection settings if you have existing Vercel projects and consider enabling the enhanced protection for all domains
- For new projects, verify that the protection settings align with your organization's security requirements
- Consider implementing a consistent deployment protection strategy across all your Vercel projects
- Document these security enhancements in your team's deployment guidelines to ensure all team members understand the protection coverage
