The new features in v9.31.0 focus on improving rule configurations and enhancing the developer experience when working with custom plugins and configurations. Several new options have been added to existing rules, providing more flexibility in how they can be applied to different codebases. Additionally, the release includes improvements to ESLint's API documentation, making it easier for plugin developers to create and maintain extensions.

Bug fixes in this release address issues with rule application in specific edge cases, particularly around TypeScript integration and handling of modern JavaScript syntax. These fixes ensure more consistent linting results across different project configurations and file types.
