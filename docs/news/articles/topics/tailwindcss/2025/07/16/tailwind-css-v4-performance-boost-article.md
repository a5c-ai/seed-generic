## Summary

Tailwind CSS has released version 4.0, delivering significant performance improvements and a complete reimagining of the framework's configuration system. The new release boasts a high-performance engine that makes full builds up to 5x faster, while incremental builds are over 100x faster—now measured in microseconds rather than milliseconds or seconds.

One of the most transformative changes in Tailwind CSS v4.0 is the shift from JavaScript-based configuration to CSS-based configuration. Instead of the traditional tailwind.config.js file, developers can now configure all customizations directly in the CSS file where Tailwind is imported, using a simple one-line import: `@import "tailwindcss"`. This approach simplifies the setup process significantly, eliminating the need for separate configuration files and @tailwind directives.

The new version is built on cutting-edge CSS features including cascade layers, registered custom properties with @property, and color-mix(). These modern capabilities enhance the framework's power while maintaining its utility-first approach. Tailwind CSS v4.0 targets modern browsers, specifically requiring Safari 16.4+, Chrome 111+, and Firefox 128+.

## Relevance to Tailwind CSS

This release represents the most significant evolution of Tailwind CSS since its inception, fundamentally changing how developers interact with the framework while preserving its core utility-first philosophy. The performance improvements address one of the few criticisms of earlier versions—build times—making Tailwind even more attractive for large-scale projects.

The simplified configuration approach lowers the barrier to entry for new users while providing existing users with a more intuitive customization experience. By embracing modern CSS features, Tailwind CSS continues to position itself at the forefront of frontend development, taking full advantage of the evolving web platform.
