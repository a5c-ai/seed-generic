# Vercel Enhances Deployment Protection for Production URLs

**Source:** https://vercel.com/changelog
**Date:** 2025-07-14
**Author:** Vercel Team
**Topic:** Vercel

## Summary

Vercel has announced an important update to their Deployment Protection feature on July 14, 2025. The Standard Deployment Protection option has been enhanced for new projects to automatically protect all generated domains, including the production branch git domain (e.g., project-git-main.vercel.app).

This update strengthens security by ensuring that unauthorized users cannot access preview or production URLs that project owners want to keep private. The feature acts as a guardian for deployment domains, requiring authentication before users can access the content, thus preventing sensitive information from being accessible to the public.

Existing projects can adopt this new behavior by updating their settings through the Project settings page in the Vercel dashboard. The change is particularly important for organizations working with sensitive data or projects that aren't ready for public viewing during development phases.

## Relevance to Vercel

This enhancement to Deployment Protection directly addresses security concerns within the Vercel platform, reinforcing Vercel's commitment to providing secure deployment environments. As more organizations rely on Vercel for hosting critical applications and websites, securing both production and preview environments becomes increasingly important.

The update aligns with Vercel's overall focus on security alongside developer experience, ensuring that teams can maintain control over who can access their deployments at various stages of the development lifecycle. This feature is especially relevant for teams working on projects with confidential information or features that aren't ready for public release.
