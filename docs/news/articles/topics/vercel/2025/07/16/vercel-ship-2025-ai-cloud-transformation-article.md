## Summary

Vercel hosted its annual Ship conference in 2025, marking a significant evolution in the platform's strategic direction. The most notable announcement was Vercel's transformation from the "Frontend Cloud" to the "AI Cloud," representing its vision for software that can think, plan, and adapt autonomously. This shift reflects the growing integration of AI into the development workflow and positions Vercel as a leader in AI-native development infrastructure.

A major highlight of the conference was the introduction of Fluid Compute with Active CPU Pricing, a new pricing model that charges only for the time code is actually executing, while "Provisioned Memory" covers waiting time at 1/11th the rate. According to Vercel, teams using this model have seen up to 85% cost savings through optimizations like in-function concurrency.

The company also unveiled Vercel Sandbox, a new environment that provides isolated microVMs supporting execution times up to 45 minutes. This standalone SDK works with non-Vercel platforms and uses the new Fluid Active CPU pricing. Additionally, Vercel introduced Rolling Releases, allowing for safe, incremental rollouts of new deployments to subsets of users with built-in monitoring and rollout controls.

## Relevance to Vercel

These announcements represent a significant strategic pivot for Vercel, moving beyond its identity as primarily a frontend deployment platform to positioning itself as an AI-first development platform. This shift aligns with broader industry trends toward AI-assisted and AI-native development processes.

The new pricing model and deployment features address key pain points for developers and organizations, particularly around cost efficiency and deployment safety. By charging only for active compute time, Vercel is making serverless functions more economically viable for a wider range of use cases, while Rolling Releases significantly reduces the risk associated with deploying new versions of applications.

## Key Insights

- Vercel's transition to the "AI Cloud" signals a strategic shift in how development platforms are evolving to incorporate AI at their core
- The Active CPU pricing model could significantly reduce costs for serverless deployments, making them more attractive for cost-sensitive applications
- Rolling Releases addresses a major pain point in deployment workflows by reducing the risk of new deployments through incremental rollouts
- Vercel Sandbox's 45-minute execution time limit expands the range of workloads that can be run on Vercel's infrastructure, potentially enabling new use cases
