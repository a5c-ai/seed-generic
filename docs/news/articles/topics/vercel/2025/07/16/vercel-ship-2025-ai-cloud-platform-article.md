## Summary

Vercel has unveiled its new AI Cloud Platform at the Ship 2025 conference, marking a significant evolution in the company's product strategy. The event, which attracted over 1,200 attendees in New York City, showcased Vercel's vision for the future of application development with a focus on AI integration.

The AI Cloud represents Vercel's expansion beyond its established Frontend Cloud platform, creating a unified environment where teams can build AI features and applications with tools designed for flexibility, speed, and security. This strategic shift positions Vercel to address the growing demand for integrated AI capabilities in modern web applications.

Alongside the AI Cloud announcement, Vercel introduced a new pricing model called Active CPU, which charges users only for the time their code is actually executing. This model is particularly beneficial for AI workloads, which often have long waiting periods but short computation times. For example, if an AI call takes 30 seconds to respond but only uses 300 milliseconds of compute, users are only charged for those 300 milliseconds, with waiting time covered at a significantly reduced rate.

## Relevance to Vercel

This announcement represents a pivotal moment for Vercel as it expands beyond its core offering as a deployment and hosting platform for frontend applications. By entering the AI infrastructure space, Vercel is positioning itself as a comprehensive platform for modern application development that encompasses both traditional frontend concerns and emerging AI capabilities.

The new pricing model addresses one of the key challenges in AI application development: the unpredictable and often costly nature of compute resources for AI workloads. By charging only for active compute time, Vercel is making AI development more accessible and cost-effective, potentially accelerating adoption among developers and organizations who might otherwise be hesitant due to cost concerns.

## Key Insights

- Vercel is strategically expanding from a Frontend Cloud to an AI Cloud platform, indicating the growing importance of AI in web application development
- The new Active CPU pricing model could disrupt traditional cloud pricing models, particularly for AI workloads where computation and waiting times vary significantly
- Vercel Sandbox, a standalone SDK that works outside the Vercel platform, suggests a more open approach to their tooling
- Recent security concerns around the misuse of Vercel's v0 AI tool for creating phishing pages highlight the importance of security in AI tooling
- The acquisition of NuxtLabs (creators of Nitro and Nuxt) signals Vercel's continued investment in the broader JavaScript framework ecosystem
