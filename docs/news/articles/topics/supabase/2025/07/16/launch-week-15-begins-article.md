## Summary

Supabase has kicked off its highly anticipated Launch Week 15, running from July 14-18, 2025. During this five-day event, Supabase is releasing new features and announcements daily at 8AM PT. Launch Week has become a tradition for Supabase, where they unveil multiple new features, improvements, and sometimes surprise releases to their platform.

The event is also being celebrated through community-driven meetups around the world, bringing together Supabase users and enthusiasts to discuss the new releases and share experiences. This format of concentrated releases has proven successful for Supabase in previous Launch Weeks, creating excitement and engagement within their community.

So far, Launch Week 15 has featured updates to Edge Functions, including the ability to create and edit Edge Functions directly from the dashboard through a new "Code" tab. This enhancement enables developers to view, edit, and deploy Edge Function source code without leaving the Supabase platform. They've also added an Edge Function tester, similar to Postman, accessible via the "Test" button for sending requests to Edge Functions directly from the dashboard.

## Relevance to Supabase

Launch Week events are significant milestones in Supabase's development roadmap, often introducing features that substantially enhance the platform's capabilities. For developers using Supabase, these concentrated release periods provide an opportunity to learn about and adopt new features that can improve their applications and workflows.

The focus on Edge Functions in the early days of Launch Week 15 highlights Supabase's commitment to serverless computing and extends the platform's capabilities beyond its core database offerings. These improvements make it easier for developers to build and deploy serverless functions within the Supabase ecosystem, reducing the need for external tools and services.
