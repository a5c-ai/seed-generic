## Relevance to Next.js

This release represents a significant step in Next.js's transition to Turbopack as its primary bundling solution.

The ongoing focus on Turbopack integration reflects Vercel's strategic investment in improving build performance and developer experience. As web applications continue to grow in complexity, efficient bundling becomes increasingly important for maintaining fast build times and optimal production assets.
