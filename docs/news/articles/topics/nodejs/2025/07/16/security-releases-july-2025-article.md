**Source:** https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/july-2025-security-releases
**Date:** 2025-07-15
**Author:** Node.js Security Working Group
**Topic:** Node.js

## Summary

The Node.js project has released security updates for multiple Node.js release lines, addressing several critical vulnerabilities. These security releases are available for the 24.x, 23.x, 22.x, and 20.x Node.js release lines, reflecting the project's commitment to maintaining security across both current and LTS versions.

These security updates follow the May 2025 security releases, which addressed vulnerabilities including a C++ method SignTraits::DeriveBits() issue that could crash Node.js processes when executing in a background thread and a flaw in Node.js 20's HTTP parser that allowed improper termination of HTTP/1 headers, enabling request smuggling attacks.

The Node.js project continues to emphasize the importance of security for production applications, as demonstrated by their new approach for handling End-of-Life (EOL) versions announced earlier this year. On January 21, 2025, Node.js released security patches and assigned CVEs to cover EOL versions, highlighting the ongoing security risks of using unsupported versions.

## Relevance to Node.js

These security releases are critically important for anyone using Node.js in production environments. They address vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited by attackers to compromise Node.js applications, highlighting the importance of keeping Node.js installations updated to the latest patch versions.

For developers using Node.js as their backend runtime, these updates reflect the ongoing maintenance and security focus of the Node.js project. The regular security releases demonstrate the maturity of the Node.js ecosystem and the commitment to providing a secure platform for web applications.

## Key Insights

- Multiple Node.js versions (24.x, 23.x, 22.x, 20.x) received security updates simultaneously, showing the project's commitment to supporting different release lines
- The security patches address several critical vulnerabilities, including issues that could potentially lead to denial of service or request smuggling attacks
- Node.js maintains a regular security release cycle, with previous updates in May 2025 and January 2025
- Users should update their Node.js installations promptly to mitigate security risks
- Organizations using older versions of Node.js should plan to upgrade to supported versions (Node.js 20 LTS or Node.js 22) as Node.js 18 will reach End-of-Life in April 2025
