# Node.js Security Releases Address Vulnerabilities

**Source:** https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/july-2025-security-releases
**Date:** 2025-07-15
**Author:** Node.js Security Working Group
**Topic:** Node.js

## Summary

The Node.js project has released security updates on July 15, 2025, addressing several vulnerabilities across multiple Node.js versions. The security patches have been deployed for all active release lines, including Node.js 22 (LTS) and Node.js 24 (Current).

These security updates resolve issues that could potentially lead to denial of service attacks, information disclosure, or code execution vulnerabilities in certain circumstances. The Node.js Security Working Group coordinated with security researchers to identify and patch these vulnerabilities before they could be widely exploited.

Additionally, the update includes a new approach to CVE management for end-of-life Node.js versions. All new CVEs issued will now include EOL (End-of-Life) releases in their applicability statements, reflecting the ongoing security risks of using outdated Node.js versions. This change is significant for organizations that may still be running legacy Node.js applications.

## Relevance to Node.js

These security releases highlight the Node.js project's commitment to maintaining a secure ecosystem. Regular security updates are critical for Node.js users, especially as the runtime is widely used in production environments for server-side applications, APIs, and microservices.

The updates are particularly relevant as Node.js continues to evolve with version 24 as the current release and version 22 as the LTS (Long-Term Support) release. Users are encouraged to keep their Node.js installations updated to benefit from these security enhancements and to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.

## Key Insights

- Security releases have been made available for all active Node.js versions, including v22.17.1 (LTS) and v24.4.1 (Current)
- The Node.js team has updated their approach to CVE management for end-of-life versions, emphasizing the risks of using outdated Node.js installations
- Node.js 18 reached End-of-Life in April 2025 and no longer receives security updates, making migration to supported versions critical
- Node.js 24 is scheduled to enter LTS status in October 2025, providing a migration path for users who require long-term support
