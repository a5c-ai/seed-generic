## Summary

Stripe has released a new FX Quotes API that empowers businesses to offer more sophisticated currency management capabilities in their applications. This new API, part of Stripe's 2025-06-30.basil API version, enables developers to display prices in local currencies, lock in exchange rates for future transactions, and access real-time exchange rates and fees.

The FX Quotes API represents a significant enhancement to Stripe's cross-border commerce capabilities, allowing businesses to provide transparent pricing in customers' local currencies while maintaining predictable revenue in their settlement currency. This helps reduce customer confusion and cart abandonment by eliminating surprises at checkout related to currency conversion.

For businesses operating globally, the API provides powerful tools to manage currency risk by locking in exchange rates for specific periods, protecting against market volatility. This is particularly valuable for businesses with longer sales cycles or subscription services where price predictability is important for customer satisfaction and financial planning.

## Relevance to Integrations

This release is especially relevant for e-commerce platforms, marketplace operators, and subscription businesses that serve customers across multiple countries and currencies. By integrating the FX Quotes API, these businesses can create more localized and transparent shopping experiences while managing the complexities of multi-currency operations.

For developers building on Stripe, this API offers new possibilities for creating sophisticated pricing strategies that account for currency fluctuations without requiring complex external forex integrations. The API fits into Stripe's broader ecosystem of payment and financial services tools, complementing existing capabilities like Stripe Tax and Adaptive Pricing.
